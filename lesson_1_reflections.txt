How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It hightlighted only the parts of the file that changed. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It allows me to go back to previous versions if I am unhappy with the progress. It also provides a backup or archive of old information.
